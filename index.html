        <p class="skillparag">I've always loved working with many kinds of Materials such as, Wood,Stone,Metal, and since young age, <br>
          You could always find me messing around such materials and exploring in a self teaching way, When i grew up i've ,<br>
          Came to the U.S and found me a Job which included working with Wood, i started at 0 Skill level and gradually worked <br>
          My way up the skill ladder in Window\Door installment, aswel as my Pay grew, My skills were very useful in later projects <br>

        <p class="skillparag">I'm a total Newbie in any Tech related sphere, well aside from gaming i guess lol, i am trying to learn Web Development <br>
          As my "late" career change, i was on the way to it and then i got badly injured, my life turned upside down to the worse <br>
          Possible way, never would imagine the things i've been through but it also molded me into a much stronger individual,<br>
          Cant lie and say i never thought it seems boring staring at the screen and basically any office\computer related work would push me away instatly!<br>
          Yet here i am, you are on My website that i Made and Designed, it isn't much but more yet to come! </p>
